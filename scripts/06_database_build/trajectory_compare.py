"""
Compare two pose trajectories (sequences of normalised landmark snapshots
across a swing) using Dynamic Time Warping — aligns sequences that differ in
length/speed, which a flattened fixed-length vector can't do. This replaces
comparing 3 fixed snapshots (backswing/contact/followthrough) with comparing
the full ~20fps motion path.

# build_pro_database.py's normalise_landmarks() docstring) turned out to be
# on a MUCH wider scale than x/y in practice -- measured directly against a
# real rebuilt database: abs-median z ~1.83 (range -17.2 to 12.3) vs abs-
# median x ~0.60. The docstring's assumption that z is "the same normalized
# image-width units as x/y" does NOT hold empirically. A live before/after
# test on 4 real saved swings (see this session's z-upgrade plan) showed
# Z_WEIGHT=0.5 caused similarity scores to drop 45-75% on 3 of 4 clips --
# z was dominating the distance metric, not contributing a minor signal.
# DISABLED (0.0) until z is properly rescaled (e.g. normalize by its own
# measured spread, not just divided by shoulder width like x/y) and
# re-validated -- do not re-enable by just picking a smaller constant here
# without re-measuring z's actual distribution first.
